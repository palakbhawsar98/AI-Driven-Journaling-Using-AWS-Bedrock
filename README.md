# ✨ The Power of Words: AI-Driven Journaling with AWS ✨

An intelligent journaling app that analyzes your entries, **uplifts you during tough times**, and **celebrates your achievements**. Whether you're feeling low or experiencing a joyful moment, the AI provides thoughtful reflections to motivate, encourage, and inspire you.
In this project, We will create a journaling app and host the website on Amazon S3. Journal entries will be stored securely in Amazon DynamoDB,  AWS API Gateway will manage secure communication between the frontend and backend, and AWS Lambda will process journal entries efficiently. Using AWS Bedrock with the Amazon Titan Text Express v1 model, the app will provide AI-driven insights to help users reflect and stay motivated.
